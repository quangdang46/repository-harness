# Symphony Web UI Controller

## Purpose

The Symphony Web UI Controller gives non-technical users a local browser surface
for controlling Harness Symphony tasks without needing to operate the CLI
directly.

The UI is a controller for existing Harness and Symphony concepts. It should not
become a second task runner, a second feature intake system, or a separate source
of truth.

## Users

- Non-technical task owners who need to start, watch, review, and approve
  Symphony work.
- Technical maintainers who need to inspect run details, logs, validation
  evidence, PR state, and sync state from the same surface.

## Product Principles

- Use simple user-facing labels. Avoid exposing Harness terms unless a detail
  panel needs them.
- Keep all tasks visible, but block unsafe actions when dependencies or active
  run rules prevent work from starting.
- Make hierarchy explicit so users can understand how feature intake breaks a
  larger request into executable work.
- Keep the MVP local-only and unauthenticated.
- Allow only one active task at a time in the MVP.
- Preserve the existing Symphony workflow: run workspace, Codex App Server
  adapter, result artifacts, PR review, merged PR, and sync.

## Task Source

Tasks come from Harness stories created during feature intake.

Feature intake is responsible for producing:

- Task hierarchy.
- Task dependencies.
- Runnable task boundaries.
- Validation expectations.

The Web UI does not create tasks in the MVP.

## Dependency Model

Dependencies live in Harness because they are produced during feature intake.

A task dependency means one task cannot move into `In Progress` until every
blocking task is `Done`.

The dependency graph must support:

- Listing direct blockers for a task.
- Listing tasks unblocked by a completed task.
- Deriving `Ready` and `Blocked` status.
- Detecting cycles before tasks are presented as runnable.
- Explaining why a blocked task is blocked in simple language.

Cycle detection is required. A cycle is a product planning error and should be
shown as a task breakdown problem, not as a user action problem.

## Board States

The primary board states are:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | The task has no incomplete blockers and can be selected. |
| Blocked | The task has incomplete blockers or a dependency cycle. |
| In Progress | The user selected the task and Symphony is running it. |
| Review | A run completed, `RESULT.json` exists, and a PR has been created. |
| Needs Attention | A run failed, was interrupted, or cannot create required review artifacts. |
| Done | The PR was merged and Symphony sync applied the accepted changeset. |

## Main Workflow

1. User opens the local Web UI.
2. UI shows task hierarchy and board states.
3. User clicks a `Ready` task.
4. The task moves to `In Progress`.
5. Entering `In Progress` starts execution like `harness-symphony run`.
6. UI shows live Codex App Server events for the active run.
7. When Codex emits `turn/completed` with completed status and required
   artifacts validate, Symphony creates a PR.
8. The task moves to `Review`.
9. User reviews summary, result, changeset, validation evidence, PR status, and
   logs.
10. After the PR is merged, the user approves sync from the UI.
11. UI runs Symphony sync.
12. The task moves to `Done`.

## Failure Workflow

If Codex fails, the run is interrupted, required artifacts are missing, PR
creation fails, or validation fails, the task moves to `Needs Attention`.

`Needs Attention` must show:

- What failed.
- The last observed Codex event or error.
- Links to run artifacts when present.
- Suggested next action.
- Retry controls when retry is safe.

## Review Surface

The review screen should expose enough information for the user to make an
approval decision without leaving the Web UI.

It should include:

- Task summary.
- Run outcome from `RESULT.json`.
- Validation evidence.
- Changed files.
- Human-readable changeset preview.
- PR link and merge status.
- Codex event log.
- Run summary.
- Approve/sync action after the PR is merged.
- Retry or mark-needs-attention actions when review artifacts are incomplete.

Raw artifacts should remain accessible from the review surface.

## Codex Event Source

The existing Symphony Codex adapter writes Codex App Server JSON-RPC events to:

```text
.harness/runs/<run_id>/APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl
```

The Web UI should stream or tail this file for the active run.

Useful event types include:

- `thread/started`
- `turn/started`
- `item/agentMessage/delta`
- `item/completed`
- `turn/diff/updated`
- `thread/status/changed`
- `turn/completed`

`turn/completed` with completed status is required before moving to `Review`.

## Local Web Boundary

The MVP should be local-only and no-auth.

The expected control surface is:

```text
harness-symphony web
```

The backend should expose local APIs for board data, task details, run start,
event streaming, review state, PR status, and sync.

The frontend should use Vite, React, and shadcn components.

## Non-Goals

- User authentication.
- Hosted team deployment.
- Multiple active tasks.
- Task creation from the Web UI.
- External issue tracker adapters.
- Replacing Harness feature intake.
- Replacing Symphony run isolation.

## Open Implementation Decisions

- Exact Harness schema for task dependency edges.
- Whether task hierarchy is stored as parent-child story fields or derived from
  story grouping metadata.
- Whether PR merge status is polled through the existing PR provider or entered
  manually for the MVP.
- Exact API shape for streaming `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl` safely to the Vite
  frontend.

## Validation Expectations

Implementation stories should include proof for:

- Dependency graph ready/blocked derivation.
- Dependency cycle detection.
- Single-active-task enforcement.
- `Ready` to `In Progress` transition.
- Codex event streaming from `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl`.
- `turn/completed` plus valid `RESULT.json` transition to `Review`.
- Failed run transition to `Needs Attention`.
- PR merged plus sync transition to `Done`.
- Browser UI flow through Playwright or equivalent.
